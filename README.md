- 👋 Hi, I’m @kevin-buck
- 👀 I’m interested in ecology. Particularly the community and landscape ecology and how mechanistic understanding derived from field studies can allow the discovery of powerful insights from large ecological data sets.
- 🌱 I’m currently an undergrad studying environmental science at the University of Notre Dame
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ecological and climate modeling
